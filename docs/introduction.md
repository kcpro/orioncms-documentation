# Orion

Orion is an open source framework built on Meteor that makes complex as well as simple apps possible with minimal effort. It's built, modified, used, and supported by an active community of people around the world.

## Getting Started

To start your orion instance the first thing you need to do is install the core package and an admin template.
Orion has two templates, one for [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and one for [materialize](http://materializecss.com).

```sh
meteor add orionjs:core
```

And now decide which one to use

```sh
meteor add twbs:bootstrap fortawesome:fontawesome orionjs:bootstrap
```

*Either `twbs:bootstrap` or similar*

*Either `fortawesome:fontawesome` or similar*

or

```sh
meteor add materialize:materialize orionjs:materialize
```

And now

```sh
meteor
```

And now go
